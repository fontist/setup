**üöÄ Here's what you're after:**

```yml
on: push

  job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: fontist/setup-fontist@v1
      - run: fontist install "Fira Code"
```

üí° You can use `fontist manifest-install manifest.yml` to install fonts listed in a manifest file similar to `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, and `Cargo.toml`.

### Inputs

- **`fontist-version`:** The version of Fontist to install. This can be an exact version lile `1.10.0` or a semver range such as `1.x` or `~1.15.0`. The default value is `latest`.

- **`fontist-token`:** The GitHub token to use when fetching the version list from fontist/fontist. You shouldn't have to touch this. The default is the `github.token` if you're on github.com or unauthenticated (rate limited) if you're not on github.com.

### Outputs

- **`fontist-version`:** The version of Fontist that was installed. This will be something like 16.0.0 or similar.

- **`cache-hit`:** Whether or not Fontist was restored from the runner's cache or download anew.

This action uses a hack to install Ruby using [ruby/setup-ruby](https://github.com/ruby/setup-ruby) but without adding it to the `$PATH`. Then, we run `gem install fontist` using that un-`$PATH`-ed Ruby version and expose only the `fontist` executable. The action is bundled using [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to a single file on each GitHub release.

and contributed to [Fontist](https://www.fontist.org).

Huge thanks to @jcbhmr for the tremendous effort in improving the Fontist
ecosystem!
